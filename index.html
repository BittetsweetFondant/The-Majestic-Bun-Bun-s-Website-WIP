  <p>This guy (who is also a girl, and a lewd anthropomorphic bunny) is actually a boring chap who happens to appear interesting in other people's eyes.
    Her skills are told in the paragraph right after the name, so there's no need to actually <em><strong>emphazise</strong></em> it. (Please do not mind the strong emphazising, I'm just testing it.)
    Anyway, this broad isn't just a boring pheck, he's also an aged fuck. (S)he was born in the last century, can you believe it? In the 1990s. That's some <b>old</b> shit right there.
    They'll be 30 before they realize and he's just starting to do something interesting in life that will actually give him some good dough, instead of doing music and theatre.
    He's also a great cook, but that values for pure mother because she can't actually do something from it because fuck you. Ha. </p>
